# Movies-Recommendation-system-using-Apache-Spark
I have developed a movie recommendation system using Apache Spark to analyze 100 million rating dataset from IMDB. Recommendation systems can be developed based on the Collaborative Filtering Algorithm or Content-Based Filtering Algorithm. For Movies Recommendation, I have applied the Collaborative filtering algorithm using Apache Spark MLLIB. Since this dataset is huge and is not feasible to compute on the local machine, so I have used Apache Spark for it. Its 100 times faster than Hadoop on RAM and 10 times faster than Hadoop on disk. The system determines the best recommendations for the people with an accuracy of RMSE 0.634 (Root Mean Square error) which is pretty decent. Apache Spark’s MLlib is the machine learning component which is handy when it comes to big data processing. It eradicates the need to use multiple tools, one for processing and one
for machine learning.
